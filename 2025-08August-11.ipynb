    "Software is hard to write. It's even harder to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in the 1970s, people also felt overwhelmed by software -- it was too big to maintain easily. They wanted a new way to write code that would make it easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alan Kay was working at Xerox PARC, and he wanted to create a programming language that would make it easier to write and maintain code. His language was called Smalltalk, and it was the first (or almost the first) object-oriented language in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea was: Divide our code into tiny pieces, each of which contains both data and functionality (nouns and verbs). Just as different cells in a biological system accept different messages and send different messages in response, Kay said that we should have cells, or \"objects,\" in our programs. Every object would know how to send certain messages, and it would react to certain messages. Different kinds of cells, or objects, would behave differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kay's idea took off:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of cells, we have objects\n",
    "- Instead of types of cells, we have classes\n",
    "- Instead of talking about sending/receiving messages, we talk about \"calling methods.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects have been around for about 50 years now. Nearly every modern programming language supports objects, and many require us to package up our code using objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that object-oriented programming is a packaging/management technique for keeping track of your code. It doesn't magically allow you to do things you couldn't do otherwise. If done right, then it allows you to build bigger systems and maintain them more easily."

And when we create a new object of type `str`, we say that it's an *instance*. Everything in Python is an object, and so everything is an instance of some class. If you want to find out the type of a given value, you can run the `type` function on it.\n",
    "- `object` -- this word is overused *FAR* too much. It means a value, so every instance is an object. But every class is also an object (because everything in Python is an object). We also have an actual class in Python called `object`, which is the most generic class out there. "
